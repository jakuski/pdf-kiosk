# PDF Kiosk

Simple app to display PDFs in kiosk mode with password protected overrides to <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F4</kbd> & <kbd>cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Q</kbd>.

## What is "kiosk mode"?
Kiosk mode essentially locks app into a fullscreen'ed state where the user cannot leave via normal means (e.g. <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>tab</kbd>).

## Why?
This was done as preperation for an event that I had to attend where I would be required to leave a PDF file open on my computer. I made this to ensure that users would only be able to see the PDF I chose and could not snoop through my computer.
